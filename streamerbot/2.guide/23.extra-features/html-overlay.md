## Introduction
This is a simple cross-platform app that runs in the background, allowing for a browser source to be displayed on the PC, over the screen, between the streamer and the content they are creating.

For example, the app comes preconfigured to show a simple dark splat that will cover most of the screen, (think Mario Kart oil spots) distracting them.

All you need to do is create a Channel Reward with the name ***SPLAT*** then relax and enjoy the distraction.

It also comes preconfigured to rain emotes down over the content on screen.

**Do not extract directly into your Streamer.bot folder.**
Any outside location or a subdirectory within your Streamer.bot folder is fine.

## Usage
In the HTML Overlay folder, simply run `HTMLWindowsOverlay.exe`. You will see a quick dark flash and then normal. An icon (like the image at top of this page) should now be in your system tray.

The HTML Overlay application is now running!

To close HTML Overlay, simply exit the application by double-clicking the icon in the system tray.
